                       OAuth Status Attestations
                draft-demarco-status-attestations-latest

Abstract

   Status Attestations act as evidence that a specific credential or
   token, whether in JSON Web Tokens (JWT) [RFC7519] or CBOR Web Tokens
   (CWT) format [RFC8392], has not been revoked and remains valid.
   These attestations are designed to be short-lived and statically
   provided to verifiers, eliminating the need for verifiers to obtain
   additional information from third-party systems about a token or a
   digital credential.

1.  Introduction

   Status Attestations play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity
   and trustworthiness of token and digital credentials.  Status
   Attestations serve as proof that a particular digital credential or
   token, whether in JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or CBOR Web Tokens (CWT)
   format, has not been revoked and is still valid.

   In many scenarios, a digital credential may be presented to a
   verifier long after it has been issued.  During this interval, the
   credential could potentially be invalidated for various reasons.  To
   ensure the credential's validity, the issuer provides a short-lived
   Status Attestation to the credential's Holder.  This attestation is
   bound to the credential and can be presented to a verifier, along
   with the credential itself, as proof of the credential's non-
   revocation status.

   Status Attestations are designed to be privacy-preserving and secure.
   These attestations are essential for enabling offline use cases and
   ensuring the security of the digital credential system.  They provide
   a balance between scalability, security, and privacy by minimizing
   the status information.

3.  Terminology

   Issuer:  An entity that ...

   Relying Party:  An entity that.... Also known as Verifier.

   Wallet Instance:  An entity that.... Also known as Wallet.

   Attestation Owner:  An entity that.... Also known as Wallet.

4.  Rationale

   Status Lists [@!I-D.looker-oauth-jwt-cwt-status-list] are suitable
   for specific scenarios, especially when the Verifier needs to verify
   the status of a credential at a later time after the User has
   presented the digital credential.  However, there are instances where
   the Verifier only needs to check the revocation status of a digital
   credential at the time of presentation, or situations where the
   Verifier should not be able to check the status of a credential over
   time due to privacy considerations.

   In scenarios where the Verifier, Credential Issuer, and Status List
   Provider are all part of the same domain or operate within a context
   where a high level of trust exists between them and the End-User, the
   OAuth Status List is the optimal solution, provided that the
   following privacy risks are either mitigated or not present:

   *  A Status List provider might be aware of the association between a
      specific list and a Credential Issuer, especially if the latter
      only issues a single type of Credential.  This could inadvertently
      reveal to the Status List provider which list corresponds to which
      Credential.

   *  A Verifier retrieves a Status List by establishing a TCP/IP
      connection with a Status List provider.  This allows the Status
      List provider to obtain the IP address of the Verifier and
      potentially link it to a specific Credential type and Issuer
      associated with that Status List.  A malicious Status List
      provider could exploit internet diagnostic tools, such as Whois or
      GeoIP lookup, to gather additional information about the
      requestor.  This could inadvertently disclose to the Status List
      provider which Credential the requestor is using and from which
      Credential Issuer, information that in some cases should remain
      confidential.

   However, Status Attestations differ significantly from Status Lists
   in several ways:

   1.  *Privacy*: Status Attestations are designed to be privacy-
       preserving.  They do not require the Verifier to gather any
       additional information from third-party systems, thus preventing
       potential privacy leaks.

   2.  *Static Verification*: Status Attestations are designed to be
       statically provided to Verifiers by Wallet Instance (Attestation
       Owner).  This means that once an Attestation is issued, it can be
       verified without any further communication with the Issuer or any
       other party.

   3.  *Token Formats*: Status Attestations are suitable for both JSON
       Web Tokens (JWT) and CBOR Web Tokens (CWT), making them versatile
       for different use cases.

   4.  *Trust Model*: Status Attestations operate under a model where
       the Verifier trusts the Issuer to provide accurate status
       information.  In contrast, Status Lists operate under a model
       where the Verifier trusts the Status List Provider to maintain an
       accurate and up-to-date list of token statuses.

   5.  *Offline flow*: A Status List can be accessed by a Verifier when
       an internet connection is present, otherwise a Status List Token
       can be included within a Digital Credential, necessitating the
       Wallet Instance to acquire a new Digital Credential for a
       specific presentation.  Differently, the Status Attestations
       enable the User to persistently use their Digital Credential, as
       long as the linked Status Attestation is provisioned, presented,
       and has not expired.

5.  Requirements

   The Status Attestation:

   *  MUST be presented in conjunction with the digital Credential.  The
      Status Attestation MUST be timestamped with its issuance datetime,
      always referring to a previous period.

   *  MUST contain the expiration datetime after which the digital
      Credential MUST NOT be considered valid anymore.

   *  enables offline use cases as it MUST be statically validated using
      the cryptographic signature of the Issuer.

5.1.  Status Attestation Request

   The Issuer provides the Wallet Instance with a Status Attestation,
   bound to a Credential so that the Wallet Instance can present it to a
   Verifier, along with the Credential itself, as a proof of non-
   revocation status of the Credential.

   The following diagram shows the Wallet Instance requesting a Status
   Attestation related to a specific Credential, to the Issuer.

   +-------------------+                         +--------------------+
   |                   |                         |                    |
   |  Wallet Instance  |                         | Credential Issuer  |
   |                   |                         |                    |
   +--------+----------+                         +----------+---------+
            |                                               |
            | HTTP POST /status                             |
            |  credential_proof=$CredentialPoPJWT           |
            |  client_assertion_type                        |
            |  client_assertion=WIA~POP                     |
            +----------------------------------------------->
            |                                               |
            |  Response with Status Attestation JWT |
            <-----------------------------------------------+
            |                                               |
   +--------+----------+                         +----------+---------+
   |                   |                         |                    |
   |  Wallet Instance  |                         | Credential Issuer  |
   |                   |                         |                    |
   +-------------------+                         +--------------------+

   *Step 1 (Status Attestation Request)*: The Wallet Instance sends the
   Status Attestation Request to the Issuer.  The request MUST contain
   the Wallet Instance Attestation with its Proof of Possession and a
   Credential Proof of Possession JWT, signed with the private key
   related to the public key contained within the Credential.

POST /status HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.example.org
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

credential_proof=$CredentialPoPJWT
&client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-client-attestation
&client_assertion=$WIA~WIA-PoP

   The Issuer verifies the signature of the PoP JWTs using the public
   key contained in the client_assertion and the Credential, which is
   the proof that the Wallet Instance owns the private keys associated
   with the Wallet Instance Attestation and Credential.  Therefore the
   Wallet Instance is entitled to request its Status Attestation.

5.2.  Status Attestation

   The Issuer checks the status of the Credential and creates a Status
   Attestation bound to it.  The Issuer creates a new Status
   Attestation, a non-normative example of which is given below.

   {
       "alg": "ES256",
       "typ": "non-revocation-attestation+jwt",
       "kid": $ISSUER-JWKID
   }
   .
   {
       "iss": "https://issuer.example.org",
       "iat": 1504699136,
       "exp": 1504700136,
       "credential_hash": $CREDENTIAL-HASH,
       "credential_hash_alg": "sha-256",
       "cnf": {
           "jwk": {...}
       }
   }

5.3.  Status Attestation Response

   The Issuer then returns the Status Attestation to the Wallet
   Instance, as in the following non-normative example.

    HTTP/1.1 201 OK
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "non_revocation_attestation": "eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IndhbGxldC1...",
    }
