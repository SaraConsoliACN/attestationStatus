                draft-demarco-status-attestations-latest

Abstract

   Status Attestations are verifiable proofs about the validity status
   of a digital credential or token, in the form of JSON Web Tokens
   (JWT) [RFC7519] or CBOR Web Tokens (CWT) format [RFC8392].  Status
   Attestations are designed to be short-lived and periodically supplied
   to their holders.  The holders then present the attestations, along
   with the associated digital credentials, to the verifiers.  This
   approach eliminates the need for verifiers to seek additional
   information about a token or digital credential from third-party
   systems.

1.  Introduction

   Status Attestations play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity
   and trustworthiness of token and digital credentials.  Status
   Attestations serve as proof that a particular digital credential or
   token, whether in JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or CBOR Web Tokens (CWT)
   format, has not been revoked and is still valid.

   In many scenarios, a digital credential may be presented to a
   verifier long after it has been issued.  During this interval, the
   credential could potentially be invalidated for various reasons.  To
   ensure the credential's validity, the issuer provides a short-lived
   Status Attestation to the credential's Holder.  This attestation is
   bound to the credential and can be presented to a verifier, along
   with the credential itself, as proof of the credential's non-
   revocation status.

   Status Attestations are designed to be privacy-preserving and secure.
   These attestations are essential for enabling offline use cases and
   ensuring the security of the digital credential system.  They provide
   a balance between scalability, security, and privacy by minimizing
   the status information.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   Issuer:  Entity that is responsible for the issuance of the Digital
      Credentials.  This includes the lifecycle of the Credentials,
      their issuance, and their validity status.

   Relying Party:  Entity that relies on the validity of the digital
      credentials presented to it.  This entity, also known as a
      Verifier, needs to verify the authenticity and validity of the
      Credentials, including their revocation status, before accepting
      them.

   Wallet Instance:  Entity that represents the digital Wallet of a
      User.  Also known as Wallet or Holder, it is responsible for
      storing and managing the User's digital credentials.  It can
      present Credentials to Verifiers and request Status Attestations
      from Issuers.

   Attestation Owner:  Entity that owns an attestation, typically the
      Holder of the Digital Credential.  Also known as Wallet or Holder,
      it is responsible for presenting the attestation, along with the
      Digital Credential, to the Verifier.

4.  Rationale

   OAuth Status Lists [@!I-D.looker-oauth-jwt-cwt-status-list] are
   suitable for specific scenarios, especially when the Verifier needs
   to verify the status of a Credential at a later time after the User
   has presented the Digital Credential.  However, there are instances
   where the Verifier only needs to check the revocation status of a
   Digital Credential at the time of presentation, or situations where
   the Verifier should not be able to check the status of a credential
   over time due to privacy requirements.

   In scenarios where the Verifier, Credential Issuer, and Status List
   Provider are all part of the same domain or operate within a context
   where a high level of trust exists between them and the End-User, the
   OAuth Status List is the optimal solution.  Other cases may expose
   the following privacy risks when using OAuth Status List [@!I-
   D.looker-oauth-jwt-cwt-status-list]:

   *  A Status List provider might be aware of the association between a
      specific list and a Credential Issuer, especially if the latter
      only issues a single type of Credential.  This could inadvertently
      reveal to the Status List provider which list corresponds to which
      Credential.

   *  A Verifier retrieves a Status List by establishing a TCP/IP
      connection with a Status List provider.  This allows the Status
      List provider to obtain the IP address of the Verifier and
      potentially link it to a specific Credential type and Issuer
      associated with that Status List.  A malicious Status List
      provider could exploit internet diagnostic tools, such as Whois or
      GeoIP lookup, to gather additional information about the
      requestor.  This could inadvertently disclose to the Status List
      provider which Credential the requestor is using and from which
      Credential Issuer, information that in some cases should remain
      confidential.

   However, Status Attestations differ significantly from Status Lists
   in several ways:

   1.  *Privacy*: Status Attestations are designed to be privacy-
       preserving.  They do not require the Verifier to gather any
       additional information from third-party systems, thus preventing
       potential privacy leaks.

   2.  *Static Verification*: Status Attestations are designed to be
       statically provided to Verifiers by Wallet Instance (Attestation
       Owner).  This means that once an Attestation is issued, it can be
       verified without any further communication with the Issuer or any
       other party.

   3.  *Token Formats*: Status Attestations are suitable for both JSON
       Web Tokens (JWT) and CBOR Web Tokens (CWT), making them versatile
       for different use cases.

   4.  *Trust Model*: Status Attestations operate under a model where
       the Verifier trusts the Issuer to provide accurate status
       information.  In contrast, Status Lists operate under a model
       where the Verifier trusts the Status List Provider to maintain an
       accurate and up-to-date list of token statuses.

   5.  *Offline flow*: A Status List can be accessed by a Verifier when
       an internet connection is present.  Differently OAuth Status List
       defines how to provide a static Status List Token, to be included
       within a Digital Credential.  This requires the Wallet Instance
       to acquire a new Digital Credential for a specific presentation.
       Even if similar to the Status List Token, the Status Attestations
       enable the User to persistently use their preexistent Digital
       Credentials, as long as the linked Status Attestation is
       provisioned, presented to the Verifier, and not expired.

5.  Requirements

   The Status Attestation:

   *  MUST be presented in conjunction with the Digital Credential.  The
      Status Attestation MUST be timestamped with its issuance datetime,
      always referring to a previous period.

   *  MUST contain the expiration datetime after which the Digital
      Credential MUST NOT be considered valid anymore.

   *  enables offline use cases as it MUST be statically validated using
      the cryptographic signature of the Issuer.

   Note that in this specification the examples and the normative
   properties of attestations are reported in accordance with the JWT
   standard, while for the purposes of this specification, any
   credential or attestation format format may be used, as long as all
   attributes and requirements of the attributes are satisfied.

6.  Status Attestation Request

   The Issuer provides the Wallet Instance with a Status Attestation,
   bound to a Credential so that the Wallet Instance can present it to a
   Verifier, along with the Credential itself, as a proof of non-
   revocation status of the Credential.

   The following diagram shows the Wallet Instance requesting a Status
   Attestation related to a specific Credential, to the Issuer.

   +-------------------+                         +--------------------+

            <-----------------------------------------------+

   |                   |                         |                    |
   |  Wallet Instance  |                         | Credential Issuer  |
   |                   |                         |                    |
   +-------------------+                         +--------------------+

   The Wallet Instance sends the Status Attestation Request to the
   Issuer.  The request MUST contain the Credential which is intended to
   obtain the Status Attestation and a Proof of Possession of it, signed
   with the private key related to the public key contained within the
   Credential.

   POST /status HTTP/1.1
   Host: issuer.example.org
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   credential_pop=$CredentialPoPJWT

   The Issuer verifies the signature of the PoP using the public key
   contained in the client_assertion and the Credential, which is the
   proof that the Wallet Instance owns the private keys associated with
   the Digital Credential.  Therefore the Wallet Instance is entitled to
   request its Status Attestation.

6.1.  Digital Credential Proof of Possession

   The Wallet that holds a Digital Credential, when requests a Status
   Attestation, MUST give the proof of possession of the Credential to
   the Credential Issuer.

   Below a non-normative example of a Credential PoP is given by the
   following JWT headers and payload:

   {
       "alg": "ES256",
       "typ": "revocation-request+jwt",
       "kid": $WIA-CNF-JWKID

   }
   .
   {
       "iss": "0b434530-e151-4c40-98b7-74c75a5ef760",
       "aud": "https://issuer.example.org",

       "exp": 1698744139,
       "jti": "6f204f7e-e453-4dfd-814e-9d155319408c",
       "format": "vc+sd-jwt",
       "credential": $Issuer-Signed-JWT
   }

   The Credential Proof of Possession MUST be a JWT that MUST contain
   the parameters (JOSE Header and claims) in the following table.

7.  Status Attestation

   The Issuer checks the status of the Credential and creates a Status
   Attestation bound to it.  The Issuer creates a new Status
   Attestation, which a non-normative example is given below.

   {
       "alg": "ES256",
       "typ": "non-revocation-attestation+jwt",
       "kid": $ISSUER-JWKID
   }
   .
   {
       "iss": "https://issuer.example.org",
       "iat": 1504699136,
       "exp": 1504700136,
       "credential_hash": $CREDENTIAL-HASH,
       "credential_hash_alg": "sha-256",
       "cnf": {
           "jwk": {...}
       }
   }

   The Status Attestation MUST contain the following claims when the JWT
   format is used.
